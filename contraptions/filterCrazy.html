            A stupid simple utility I made for my friend <a href="https://emily.gg/">emily</a> in a very small ammount of time. 
            It modulates a (stereo) biquad filter at audio rate with an LFO using the chape in the shape editor.
            Because biquad filters are silly, they more or less explode when you modulate them fast enough. <br><br>
            Hopefully this is fun to mess around with despite its extreme simplicity.
