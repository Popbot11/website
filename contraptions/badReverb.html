    <p>a terribly optimized and terrible sounding reverb i made in gen a bit ago. with very specific settings it sounds alright, 
    but i wouldn't use it as a normal reverb. <br>
    parameter randomization, when on, will periodically randomize the delay times of all the allpasses at once. generally, this 
    sounds pretty shit. the toggle inthe bottom right will randomize allpasses manually if you want to switch up the sound. generally the way
    that you would use this device would be to randomize the allpasses until it sounds serviceable. </p>
