    should be self explanatory. <br>
    25 sliders on left are left channel, 25 on right are right channel. <br>
    top row sloders is delay time, bottom is feedback. <br>
    i know technically it's 50 parallel delays spread accross two channels. this is just what i called the file. <br>
    iirc i made this in a call with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lukasipo">lukas</a> or maybe <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aowaves">AO</a>. maybe both.
