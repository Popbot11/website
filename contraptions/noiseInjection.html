            noise injection is a pretty simple device intended for use with subs (but can be used with anything). <br>
            Specifically, it adds noise (and/or a specified external input signal) onto the portion of the input signal that falls above or below a specified gain threshold. It's pretty okay at creating that nice crispy noisy sub sound. <br>
            Above level and below level control the levels of the noise/sidechain for the signals that falls above and below the threshold, respectively. 
            Smoothing controls how smooth the transition accross the threshold is.
            Mode interpolates between a subtractive mode (0) where noise is subtracted from the input signal, and a multiplicative mode (1) where noise is multiplied by the input signal. Crazy mode activates crazy mode.<br><br>
            If you have any questions, lmk and i'll help you out to the best ot my ability. Keep in mind this thing is free and was made in a day, so it's probably got a whole lot of issues (such as working poorly with atency sometimes), and lacks a lot of features that people probably want. If you've got any requests i'll add it to the list of things to include in a possible v2.
