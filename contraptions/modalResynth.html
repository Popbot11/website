        <a href="../index.html">home</a> | <a href="./modalSynth.html">New version</a><br><br>
        A modal resonator that can analyze an input signal and map its harmonics onto the resonator in realtime. 
        it's currently very unfinished, so i'll update this page as I make progress. 
        maybe it'll have a single update with a finished version, maybe it'll have like 30. idk. 
        i'll seperate updates with horizontal dividers.

        <p>skeletal version. only 8 bands, monophonic, no ui, no ux, really scuffed stuff.
             this is just the raw concept. I doubt this is useful to anybody since it doesnt have a ui but i figured i'd put it up here anyways since i spent a couple days on this prototype</p>

            added a bunch of functionality. added a mode display UI, a very functional impulse generator, and a number of smaller tweaks. 
            I'm yet to implement polyphony and an actual  designed ui, but i'm not gonna do that today.

            added polyphony (up to 16 voices), added a super super basic ui, ported to amxd. it should work in ablton now without max msp. <br>
            got some people to test it too, and i got some pretty valuable feedback regarding the UI that i intend to implement. <br>
            i also kinda want to rework the signal flow a bit so that i can implement more moduoation options a bit easier. here's a draft of an alternative signal flow i put together in an obsidian canvas

            decided to abandon the max for live stuff now and to instead focus my attention on finishing all the features first, and then implementing it into a device with a UI. 
            i have a more final list of things i want to do down, all thats left is tyo actually do it. <br>
            I've finished the sampler part of it, and refined the polyphony a bit i think. I stoped working on a m4l thing, so its back to a max patch now. <br>
            the sampler sounds really pretty with the polyphony, i love it so much. Anyways, here's the picture and downloads:

            this is probably the final update on this page, because I intend to see this device for money. I think t's fair to give people access to the main max patch for free, 
            but if you want the m4l device you'd have to pay ideally. idk. makes sense to me. <br>
            anyways, this version has a lot of updates, its the mostly final evolution of the dsp. 
            the main things I added were stereo, the harmonic prism which works similarly to harmor's harmonic prism in multiply mode, a 'reso morph' feature which can morph between two per-mode resonance settings, 
            a fully-featured polyphonic mod matrix with 2 envelopes and 2 lfos, velocity (which is a bit jank) and per-voice per-parameter randomization. These features <i>MASSIVELY</i> expand the sound for the device,
             and is mostly the final evolution of what i want it to be. Any additional features i can think of are to be aded in a v2 of the device that i mght make later. What i'm working on now is mostly UI,
              UX, and cpu optimization for the m4l version. Initally it was taking about 80% cpu, and ive gotten it down to around 30 - 40, but I want it to be under 10, so theres a lot of work ahead of me. <br>
              I've decided to remove the resynth options from the device cause it doesn't work very well in compartson to all the other things i've made for it

            OH ALSO i'm updating this after the release of the final thing, but i just remembered another one ofthe super old test builds i made. This was the very first implementation of a modal resonator in a max for live device, which had 32 modes and sounds like crap. You're welcome to download it and give it a try.
