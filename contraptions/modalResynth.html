        A modal resonator that can analyze an input signal and map its harmonics onto the resonator in realtime. 
        it's currently very unfinished, so i'll update this page as I make progress. 
        maybe it'll have a single update with a finished version, maybe it'll have like 30. idk. 
        i'll seperate updates with horizontal dividers.

        <p>skeletal version. only 8 bands, monophonic, no ui, no ux, really scuffed stuff.
             this is just the raw concept. I doubt this is useful to anybody since it doesnt have a ui but i figured i'd put it up here anyways since i spent a couple days on this prototype</p>

            added a bunch of functionality. added a mode display UI, a very functional impulse generator, and a number of smaller tweaks. 
            I'm yet to implement polyphony and an actual  designed ui, but i'm not gonna do that today.

            added polyphony (up to 16 voices), added a super super basic ui, ported to amxd. it should work in ablton now without max msp. <br>
            got some people to test it too, and i got some pretty valuable feedback regarding the UI that i intend to implement. <br>
            i also kinda want to rework the signal flow a bit so that i can implement more moduoation options a bit easier. here's a draft of an alternative signal flow i put together in an obsidian canvas

            decided to abandon the max for live stuff now and to instead focus my attention on finishing all the features first, and then implementing it into a device with a UI. 
            i have a more final list of things i want to do down, all thats left is tyo actually do it. <br>
            I've finished the sampler part of it, and refined the polyphony a bit i think. I stoped working on a m4l thing, so its back to a max patch now. <br>
            the sampler sounds really pretty with the polyphony, i love it so much. Anyways, here's the picture and downloads:
