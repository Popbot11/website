            # THIS IS A WIP :)
            buffer-gen is a sort of long-term project of mine. Previous to this i haven't ever really tried to program anything from scratch. I've done a little bit of coding in the past but it was mostly very small scripts for larger projects, usually in max. <br>
            for this, I'm using Rust, which i am learning allong side my progress on this project. I am also a beinner coder so my code will by no means be good. I'm using the scope of this project as a tool for myself to be motivated to learn something challenging, which is the Rust programming language, as well as just coding concepts in general. <br><br>
            my aim is to create some software that can process and synthesize audio using non-realtime methods by freely passing buffers between modules. Ideally, the interface would present some sort of module node-based workflow, which would then be converted (somehow... havent figured that much out yet) into a network of modules passing buffers between each other, which would then synthesize/process audio according to the indicated signal flow. The important bit is that it's non-realtime. <br>
            an example use case would be to like... idk. generate a bunch of kick samples in bulk. You could establish some network of modules that generates a kick sample, and attach that network to a module that renders whatever network is above it in the chain multiple times. if you included a random source in that repeated network, you could generatively synthesize a bunch of kick samples in bulk. <br>
            or maybe you wanna normalize a bunch of samples at the same time, or do some wild convolution or feedback shit that isn't feasable with realtime audio.. idk. that's the goal. as i'm writing this i have the structure for the way modules interact with eachother to allow for (within reason) infinite inputs, outputs, and instances of modules, although i haven't gotten much past that. I'm uploading devlogs to an alternate youtube channel, here' sthe url to that channel:

        <p>oh also here's a <a href="https://github.com/Popbot11/buffer_gen">github repository</a> if this ever gets to a point where it's actually usable (or if you just wanna look at my bad code)</p>
