    <p>i am listening to this right now as i start building the infrastructure of this website. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k6MJpYcQp9rIToglz8iuFKAcerv16bph8" target="_blank">music</a>. thanks gros</p>

    <p>7-29-24 | <a target="_blank" href="https://amfivolia.bandcamp.com/album/seawards">Amfivolia - Seawards</a> | if you are reading this right now you are required to click on the link and listen to this EP. I wanna gush about it but honestly i dont think anything i could say would do it justice. just listen for yourself. maybe close your eyes; it's very visual. </p>
    <p>8-19-24 | <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/vorso/sets/holonomy">Vorso - Holonomy</a> | Bass music album that's been inspiring me quite a bit recently with my bass music related projects (especially .setique). Something about the way these tracks are structured is very very satisfying to me, which isn't somethign I hear too much in bass music. Granted i dont listen to too much mainstream bass stuff so my sample size is very small, but that doesn't matter because this is the album thats inspiring me, not something else. I feel like a lot of "experimental bass" or "idm" bass music really nails the sound design and flows and stuff, but doesn't often do anything unique or inspiring with the arrangements. So hearing this album is nice and refreshing in that regard. Track 14, shroud, is in my opinion the best example of this. Also, it goes fucking HARD, insano style. </p>
    <p> 8-19-24 | <a target="_blank" href="https://patriciataxxon.bandcamp.com/album/techdog-1-7">Patricia Taxxon - TECHDOG</a> | one of my favourite creative works that exists, currently. The tracks on the 6th and 7th albums are especially emotionally impactful for me.
        Her extreme control over texture and the way she is able to bring out very specific emotions with relatively simple and abstract sounds and movements is incredibly effective. There's a lot mroe I could say about individual tracks, but honestly just go out and listen to it instead. 
        Actually no fuck it i'm doing some more analysis right here and right now. But listen first. Or not. Do whatever. Spoilers ahead. Analysis time: <br><br>
        There's three specific moments that I wanna talk about, which i'll adress in chronological order. The first occurs at the transition between the fifth and sixth albums. The last track of the fifth album ends with a slow build into an incredibly dense noise pool of unfathomable weight, followed by nearly twenty seconds of perfect silence. The start of the following track (now in the 6th album) starts off with a pretty meaty transient, followed <i>immediately</i> by 10 minutes of more or less homogenious noise. Unliek the noise in the previous track, this noise can't really be described in terms of mass because even attempting to do so would likely cause this paragraph to collase into a singularity. Listening to this feels like I am *literally* being crushed. I *literally* was unable to move when i first heard this. It made by body feel weak. This is partially due to the contrast between the leading stretch of absolute silence, but also to the layers upon layers of slowly evolving textures that coagulate into this pure expression of weight and wrath. The effectiveness of this moment cannot be understated. <br>
        I was going to discuss two more moments (as i mentioned earlier) but honestly that was a lot of writing. I'll come back in a few hours after I get some sleep to do the other two.

    <p>1-20-25 | <a target="_blank" href="https://zacharypaulreleases.bandcamp.com/album/a-meditation-on-discord">Zachary Paul - A Meditation on Discord</a> | Some of my fav ambient music. I don't have very many specific detailed thoughts about this. It just sounds really incredible. You should give it a listen :)</p>

    <p>1-23-25 | <a target="_blank" href="https://dorianconcept.bandcamp.com/track/let-it-all-go">Dorian Concept - Let It All Go</a> | I rarely listen to music on loop, but I loove having this track on repeat. I've used it as a reference track for mix and texture for a while. Here's some unorganizd yappping about why I like it: <br>
        The stabs in the 2nd half directly inspire a lot of my own texture design and sound design. In terms of LUFS or other objective measurements, this track isn't very loud. But I think perceptually this is one of the loudest tracks I know of because of the way that it handles simplicity and contrast. <br>
        The second half of the track is magnificent. All the rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, contextual,  textural, textual, and timbral qualities work together to produce a string of moments that exude continuous release. The push and pull of the track feels entirely natural, like the only force that causes it to move originated from inside the track. That description kinda makes me sound a bit wacky style but idk how else to say it. <br>
        nothing wrong with sounding a bit wacky style from time to time. after all it'd be incredibly tone deaf for me to put up a facade of <span id="serious">seriousness</span>  on a website that looks like <i>this</i> lmao</p>
