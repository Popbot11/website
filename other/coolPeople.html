    <h1>cool people</h1>
    <p>friends of mine who make awesome things that you may not have heard of and should observe because it will likely improve your life. 
        a lot of my music has been heavily inspired by theirs. </p>

    <!--amfivolia, juha, emilydotgg, lukasipo, glyphli, napz-->
    <p><b>napz</b><br>
    she makes very highly detailed and enormously organic music. She has a very synesthetic way of conceptualizing sound, which i think is extremely evident in her work.
     As i'm writing this, she's mostly worked on microcomposition stuff (associated with e-veryday). check out her work
     <a href="https://soundcloud.com/xnapzz" target="blank">here</a>
    </p>

    <p><b>glyphli</b><br>
    i percieve her work as being very deep, powerful, and vivid. she has incredible control over texture and space.
    she also does dsp stuff.

    <p><b>lukasipo</b><br>
    its difficult to describe lukas' music for me. it's awesome and fucked and feels like it was made in collaboration with
    some non-human intelligence. Completely unlike anything else. lukasipo.

    <p><b>emilydotgg</b><br>
    emily generally makes incredibly fucked bass "music". listening to her music is like being drowned in wet-- but quickly drying-- cement.
    she also does dsp stuff, including a few incredibly creative and fucked plugins. 
    check out her music <a href="https://soundcloud.com/emilydotgg" target="blank">here</a> and her software stuff <a href="https://emily.gg/" target="blank">here</a>
    </p>

    <p><b>juha</b><br>
    juha makes very textural and motion-based music. it's difficult to find adjectives that can accurately sum up what he makes, so i'm not gonna try
    for fear of improperly representing it.

    <p><b>amfivolia</b><br>
    insanely talented multidisciplinary artist. he is brilliant at conveying stories, enviornments, and ecologies within his work.
