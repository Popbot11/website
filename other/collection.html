        <p>this is a collection of assorted media that i like for various reasons. not really organized in a pre-meditated way. this page if it continues to evolve is going to be a mess, no doubt. but that's kind of beautiful though isn't it?<br><br>

                <h2>old furry web pages</h2>
                i sometimes like exploring old places online. im not an expert or historian or really know anyting about what imi doing. i just like following links and seeing where it takes me. given im a furry i find it particularly interesting what the fandom was like when i was still a ovum.
                I usually chart out my explorations in obsidain canvases but after trying to embed one of those it's horrible and i don't really want to. unfortunately this means that i wont as easily be able to convey the branching paths and non-linear path of my journey through the web. <br>
                also check <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nLjN3auDTWK9CIGDIwa315VoTb8VaBHNIFkmw-65r8s/edit?tab=t.0">this doc </a>out, it's extremely awesome and cool. made by <a href="https://linktr.ee/desx_">desx</a>(<a href="https://archive.org/details/lumis-old-internet-exploration-document">static archive.org version</a> as of 1/30/2025 in case the link goes dead or someting else happens. i generally trust archive.org's stability over google's since its a non-profit)

                <h2>hobbyist radio stations</h2>
                <p>i found a community of people who maintain(ed) their own radio station using diy or hobby-oriented methods. here's somoe of the sites i found within that sphere. again ost of these are older but some are still updated. in contracst to the furry pages which mostly were made by teenagers or generally very young people, a lot of these sites were made by peope who are much older. like retirement age. so its an entirely different vibe. you get less slang and a lot more technical talk.</p>
                actually i've decided im really tired and wanna work on some music now so i'm gonna just link this page that links out to a bunch of other sites and finish updating this page with more detail in the future!!!! meow meow bye bye <a href="https://www.ten-ten.org/resources/ten-ten-member-pages">this is the link you click now</a>
