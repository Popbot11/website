            when i was 11 years old I was enrolled in a week long summer coding camp through a universety near our house called KidOYO. <br>
            this coding camp was my first exposure to computer coding; I learned basic coding concepts through python javascript and scratch, as well as some basic html and css. <br>
            The camp had/has a sort of custom site builder thing where you can have a website on the oyosite domain using your own html code. <br>
            I recently found the website through google results, annd figured it would be cool if I shared it here. <br>
            Keep in mind, i made this when i was 11. the website's contents are the writings of a 11-year-old pre-pubescent preteen. <br>
            also, I want to mention that the 'team websites' button links to the websites of some other people that were in my group in the summer camp. I made the team hub website (with the green square that moves around) but everything else except for that home page and my own website I didn't make. <br>
            anyways, here it is: <a href="http://popbot1.oyosite.com/website/index.html" target="blank">old website</a>
