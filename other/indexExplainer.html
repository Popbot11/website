    <P>For the sake of my own sanity, I dont think I want to organize the links on this page in a detailed way.
        I was considering labeling items with the date, type, description, or something like that. 
        Although more readable/accessable, this probably would be more difficult to maintain, especially if I decided to implement a more granular and less objective categoration system, which isn't completely future-proof.
        <br>
        So, instead of using an exhaustive labelling system, each one of these links will navigate to a page containing relevant information. This could be a description, some files, more links, idk. 
        I'm trying to design the layout of this website so that I can easily expand upon it if needed, and this feels like the most intuitive method for me specifically.  
        <br>
        As i'm writing this now, I'm realizing that having my momentary yapping at the top of a webpage meant to last me a while <i>probably</i> isn't a great idea. so this whole thing might be tucked under a link in the future. Not sure. That's Future Robin's problem.
    </P>
    <p>
        I will try to add new items to the top of their respective category, but I can't guarantee that I have the correct chronology for projects that predate this website (which I first started on April 6th 2024).
    </p>
