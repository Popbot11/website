         Hey! I had swimming today.  My friend came over for a voice 
         lesson with my mom.  We were doing testing today in swimming.  We had to do 
         4 laps! ugh.  We're doing the same thing tomorrow, but they are testing us on
         different things, so I don't know what to expect.  Sorry I didn't do my blog yesterday
         and the day before.  I just didn't have enough time.  Yesterday we just had a game day.
         We did pictionary, which was my sister's choice, and Monopoly, which was my choice.
         We didn't finish Monopoly because I was too pouty.  The day before, I went over to
         my friend's house and went in their pool with a bunch of other people.  Thanks for 
         reading my blog. Bye!

            Hey guys! Today was a rilly exiting day! I got 5th place or some thing in a 1/4m
            race! After the race, Mom did a 4m race. She got 1st place in the age
            35-39 girls divison! She didn't expect that! After that, I went on a 
            bounscy house with a rilly steep slide and some annoying kids. I got
            2 burns. Ugh. Then I got a cherry snow cone.It was gross. Then we came
            home and I read Harry Potter Part 5. I read 2 chapters. Then we went
            to Jhon Harberts;I ate half a chicken pot pie then we came home and
            I did this! Pretty fun day don't ya' think?

         Day #6: August 23, 2015   
        </p>       
            Hey! There's not much going on today except that my sister has a violin
            concert at a coffee shop. But I thought that since there's not much going
            on today, I could tell you about the great summer I had this year (2015).
            So, first I had this awesome tennis camp at the ________ high school. Then 
            I went to the Kidoyo camp that <b>tought me how to do Html !</b>So if
            it wasn't for that camp,you wouldn't be reading this!  Then my Aunt Kathy
            who is a famous vegan food blogger came to visit us. We went to the beach
        	and did other stuff. Kathy took us to the city and took my sister to the
            American Girl Doll store (ugh). Then we went to the lego store and I got 
            a third of a set for free from the store manager, and I did pick-a-brick. 
            Then, Kathy took us to a musical called Wicked at Broadway.  It was my first
            musical.  And while we were there, we saw a famous a cappella group called
            Pentatonix. Two of the members were in the audience!  The musical was pretty
            good.  I also did swimming lessons that week. The next week, there was nothing 
            going on, but out of the ordinary, I tried to jump onto a rock, and I ended up 
            getting 3 stitches in my shin. Ugh! The next week, we went on an awesome camping
            trip in Maine (with my stitches!) We went swimming in the lake next to our
            campsite a lot. Then, we hiked to the summit of a mountain called Bald Mountain.
            Then we went to a hike called Angel Falls.  I hated it at first, but then I liked
            it! Then we went to a place called Smalls Falls, and I played in the water, and 
            I also slid down a mini waterfall for fun! Also, we got $37 worth of pastries.
            And we ate lots of pizza and ice cream and roasted marshmellows. Then we came 
            home from camping and we had a few weeks to ourselves. Then I did the Avalon camp.
            And I got a horrible scratch on my elbow and smashed my finger in the door and
            I got one more injury but I can't remember it. It was also incredibly fun. We even
            went to a salt marsh. I caught a few crabs but no fish.:( Then I did my second week
            of swimming lessons  because I missed the second week when I hurt my shin. That leads
            up to now! I know that was a lot, but it was worth it.

            Hey guys! The first day of school was yesterday and it was great!
            I have a great teacher! He made us do a test
            that was like the test that porfessor Lockheart (the defence aganst the arts
            teacher) gave in his first class in the 2nd harry potter book. It was hilarious!
            Then we did the same thing but for us! Before that we spent some time organising
            our suplys. After that we went to art. Then after the test we went home! we did
            have lunch and snack at one point to. After I got home I begged to wach a 
            Minecraft video and after that I exploded (not literally) ! Then we went to
            play tennis with my mom. Then we went home and I exploded again! (again, not literally)
            Then I went to have dinner and... I exploded  ;)

            around the world with the basket ball. We then coleckeg pretty leavs. As

             Larry said "I know! lets play a lie game! Who ever says 
             the best lie wins!" "Okay" Sayed Bob. "I go first." sayes Bob
                "I have a cat" Is Bob saying a lie or telling the truth?

            home, we made Babycakes and had a pooled pork dinner. Then we watcheh
            Harry Potter #3. On the day before that, Ihad a drum lesson, then sung
            in a canon in my sister's music class. Then, I was drumming on some
            S.B.U. trash cans and these teenagers started drumming with me from
            a railing of a balkney! We took turnd drumming and stopped. That was
            really awesome. I then went over to my friend's house and played infection
            and regular tag. I also felt left out in the basement and lust silently built

    Hello  guys!!!!!! Sory I haven't been updating my blog. I had school, other stuff,
            and i just basicly just forgot about it! A new book is coming out soon on my 
            page with all my creations. It's frequently updated! I just went to an FLL
            pratcice. It went well. Sortove! We got there, and I started shivering because
            it was so cotd OUT there! Then we got inside and all my friends formed a line
            and we jamed ourselvs inbetween two warm out of order vending machines. 
            Then, we went to the gym and set up our station. We had three Lego robots,
            Legos, and a computer.  Our team talked and we got called
             over for our first turnement.
            Two member  s went up at the table and ran the robot. We got crushed. We only
            compleated one easy mision and the people porgot to run the 2nd program.
            we went back to the set up and talked for a minute then we went to a pratcice area and practiced
            twice. We then went back to the main area and had the 2nd turment. we did beter but we still did prety bad! :(
             We did that same thing again and then had lunch. I got a hot dog.
             then we did our last turnament and I was up I did beter then the last time but as alwayse,
            still did prreeeety baaad. Then we went home and I started writing my blog! Bye!

            Day #TWENTY!!!! 1/18/SISTEEN
        </p>

        Hello everybody! Sorry I haven't written my blog in a while. I suprisingly forgot 
        about it. So HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERY BODY! IT'S 2016!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
         I didn't see the ball drop, but I stayed at my friend's house until
        midnight! I think that that's much more fun then standing  with a bunch of
         21 year olds being as loud as they possibly can! Yesterday I did go to Manhatten
            Island to go to a baby shower for my FIRST COUSIN! YAY! After the shower,
          we walked 20 blocks to the Roosevelt Island Tram.  It was snowing, and I was really
            cold. The tram was fun.  It only took about 3 minutes.  But it was still fun. 
            It wobbled a little bit in the wind, but I was fine. When we got to the island,
            I watched the gears of the tram turning. It was cool! Then we went to this pizza
            restaurant. It was probably the worst pizza restaurant in the whole city! 
            I got chicken parm pizza. It wasn't that good. But afterwards I went to Starbucks
            and got a hot chocolate. When we were exiting Startbucks, I spilled the amazing hot
            chocolate on my coat! Ugh! We walked back to the tram and I discovered I was nauseous.
            We got back on the tram, and about five minutes after the tram ride was over, I felt
            better. Then we got into the car and followed Siri's directions to my uncle's apartment
            in Brooklyn. The directions that we followed, in the snow, in the dark, took us through
            this really, sort of, abandoned warehousy kind of area. It was sort of creepy.
            Then we got to my uncle's apartment. We spend about an hour there. During that hour,
            my uncle showed me some cool art projects he made, and I also played ipad. We 
            also talked a lot. So we drove home, I fell asleep, and about 12 hours later I woke
            up. Then about 3 hours later, I went to this cool art program. We made an abstract
            face with pastels and water colors. Then we made 3 dimensional shapes with paper
            and flourescent markers. I combined 2 pyramids to make this cool, kind of, 
            pyramidy thing. It was fun! So then about 6 hours later, I watched a Nova, and then
            started writing this! Bye!

            Day #21 2/2716
        </p>
        <p>
            So over the Feb. break, we went to the beach. Yes. I know. WIERD!
            We climbed the light house at Robert Moses and we met the person
            that works in the light house. She was really nice and she answered
            allot of questions. Then, we went to the beach and I found the biggest
            pile of sea fome ever. I put my feet in it and I said "Hey! Look! Theres
            fome on my feet!" Then we welked a little firther and i found a MOUNTIAN
            of sea fome. It was like 2 feet tall! I litearlly <i>swam</i> in it!
            So then I got compleatly ffffffrrrrrreeeeeezzzzziiinnnngggg.....!!!!
            Then we went back to the car and learned about exploding ballons that the
            Japanese tried to cause terror for revenge. About 6,7,8 days later,
            I went to somthing called Day Of Percussion. First, we went to a Gamelan
            (translation: orchestra) performance.  There were lots of weird foreign
            xylophone thingies. They played lots of really really cool music.  It was 
            mostly minor and it was really syncopated. It was also layered music. When the 
            four songs were done, they let us play with the instruments. I decided that I didn't
            want to then I wanted to then I didn't want to then I wanted to. I started with
            the two gigantic gongs. It's really satisfying to hit them. Just smack it! Then I
            went to one of the smaller weird xylophone thingies.  I checked out the scale, and
            then decided I was a little bit embarrassed so I stopped. Then I tried to get my hands
            on the cool bells, but they were already un-setting up, if you know what I mean. 
            So then, we ate dinner -- it was after school. I got a slice of cheese pizza, some
            water, and, best of all, some starbursts. When we finished dinner, we went to a 
            master class.  The guy leading the class was the guy who plays the drums in the 
            Spongebob theme song. I thought that was pretty funny. He taught us mostly about
            polyrhythms (look it up!) and "if you don't like a type of music you still have to
            play it anyway!" He was a really fun guy (he was a mushroom -- get it, "fungi").
            After the master class, we finally got to do our tiny performance. The tempo was
            too slow for me, so it was basically a big "FAIL in caps." So after that, we
            listened to some really cool other performances, and most of them were really cool.
            My favorite one was called "Desert Race." I could really envision how it was actually
            racing in the desert. It was mostly xylophones and I think it was in minor. During
            all the performances, I won three raffles! In the first one, I got drum sticks and a 
            drum key. In the second one, I got a drum head and a drum key! In the third one,
            I got a timpani book and a drum key! I'm rich!!! So thanks for taking so much time
            reading this gigantic paragraph, more like a blob. So thanks!

            This is giong to be a blog post about what I did this summer.
            So, first, I did a tennis program. It was fun! Then, Durring CJG's birthday,
            we went horse back riding. Afterwards, We stopped by a McDonnalds
            and we nocked on the bathroom door. This loco lady
            said "I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM! This is redulous" then, I said "YOU'RE REDICLUS!" 
            Then, I did a little music camp. I got to play a concert afterwards. 
            Then, we went camping for a whole week! With my grandmaw! We climbed a mountian
            and went river rafting. I almost broke half the bones in my body
             beecause I fell out of my inner tube. It WAS NOT fun. But it was. In the lake at the campsite,
            Me and mom went night swimming almost every night. It was so fun and relaxing.
            Also, mom SKINNYDIPPED! When we got back  from camping,
            I went to <a href="https://summer2016.oyoclass.com/mine"> kidOYO  </a>It was awesome!
            I learned how to do scratch, python, and other awesome things. It was my second year.
            I also got to play on a minecraft server that was hosted by the mentor of kidoyo.
            That WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
            Too many exclamation marks. Then, I hung out with my grandmaw. Then, I went to
            <a href="http://avalonparkandpreserve.org/youth-programs/">  Avalon summer camp.</a>
            It was pretty cool. And then, I did a swimming program at the  holtville pool.
            The pool was warm and the teachers were nice. Then, I stayed home for the rest of the 
            summer and went to school (5th grade!)  on 3/6/16. I hade a great summer!

            Day #28 4/10/17. Yes, I know. I haven't updaten in seven months. Sorry.
           
        </p>
        <p>
            HELLO!!! I'm back! So, here's a little update on my progress as a person.
            First of all, my birtday is in four days! I'm probably getting some games on the TV.
            I started reading a new series called "PENDRAGON". It is not about the king. There are
            10 books in the series, and I'm half way through the ninth. I read a lot.
            I have been learning a little javascript, but it's just a little. I learned a new tag, wich enables this: <br>
          <button onclick='alert("your computer has been hacked ")'>
              Click me!
            </button>
            <button onclick='alert("Just kidding! ")'>
                Click me again!
                             </button>
            <br>
            Cool, right! I also learned about the two javascript functions called document.write, and
            variables. For example, the bold number is the document.write function, and the expression 
            is the variables. Look in the source code to understand.<br>
            <script>
            var a = 1
            var b = 2
            var c = 3
            </script>
         <i>a+b+c</i> =1+2+3
            <br>
          1+2+3=
            <b>
            <script>
              document.write (a+b+c)  
                </script>
            </b>
      <br><br>
            Today, we went to the beach. First, we climed the lighthouse. I was scared that  I would fall
            down... and <b><h1>
            <i>DIE!</i>
            </h1></b>
            <h6>
                But I didn't!
        </h6>
        <br><br>
        After that, we walked on the beach. I took my shoes 
        off and went in the water. That was a mistake. It was <i>FREEZING!</i>
        After that, I dug a hole. Then sat in it. I felt good. 
        I then found some sand crabs, then started walking  to the car. 
        While we were walking,
        mom saw some sea shells and collested them. While she
        was doing that, I dug more holes. Then, we started walking again.
        When we got to the car, we started driving, and while were driving,
        we saw a RED FOX, and a deer.
       Oh, and another thing that happened while we were walking,
        we saw a pair of piping plovers. PIPING PLOVERS ON THE <a href="https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/pipingplover/
            pipingpl.html">ENDANGERED LIST!!</a> So, that sums up my day so far. Have a nice day!
        Oh, and here is a link to the javascript I learned. <a href="http://100pchtmlwithpopbot1.oyosite.com/javascript_hub.html">Click</a>
