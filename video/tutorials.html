            I occasionally make tutorials about sound design and other technical electronic music related things. My older ones (naturally) aren't very good, but i think that some of my more recent ones contain some pretty useful information. especially the physical modelling one, i think i have some good stuff to say in that one. I try to not get too detailed about specific methodologies and instead aim to give overviews of various ways of thinking or general processes that can be used creatively in many different ways. I think it's valuable for artists to take information and be encouraged to apply that in their own way instead of perscriptively dictating a series of steps that will yeild a particular result. Of course that has value but that's not what I <i>personally</i> want to be making. I suppose it's up to you to decide if i'm successful at that. Hopefully ill make some more tutorials in the future; it's reasonably difficult to record video with a roomate and a laptop with integrated graphics haha
