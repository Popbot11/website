            <p> writing all this 8/19/2024 12:41 AM, which may be somewhat important context. -- <br><br>
                There's a track that I planned for this EP that probably will never be finished due to the project file refusing to open for some unknown reason. 
                I'm very very proud of if tho, and still want people to hear it. At this point in my life i feel like it's probably my favourite thing 
                i've made in terms of writing, arrangement, and overall composition. Here's the unfinished version (private link): <br>
                <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1855430841%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-rn4GJqEa4w3&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/popbot1" title="Popbot" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Popbot</a> 路 <a href="https://soundcloud.com/popbot1/holes-in-the-sky-2/s-rn4GJqEa4w3" title="Holes In The Sky" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Holes In The Sky</a></div>
                <br>
                I'll probably remove this if I end up putting out a finished version of the track, but it's probably worth checking just in case because there's still a non-zero chance that we will find ourselves in a universe where I both get the project file working (subsequently finishing the project) and forget to update this page. <br>
                Also, about the cover for the track: It used to be an image that i found to be funny depicting William Osman looking annoyed as he is standing next to somebody in a full fursiut. but i just now changed this to a photograph taken by my friend <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ceruleanmei">mei</a> of some sort of forest organism
                because i dont want to accidentally jumpscare people who may not be used to viewing furries. Although this EP is very "furry" in concept so idk maybe it's fitting. who cares, enjoy the photography :3
                
            </p>
            <p>
                also, to elaborate more on the furry thing: Yes, I am a furry. This is an EP inspired by somewhat furry-like concepts that I relate to personally. It's difficult to explain because it's all very abstract, 
                but the best way i can describe it at this early stage in my life is the experience of being in some form of agreement or resonance with the creature that's inside of me. Keep in mind, 
                I am eighteen years old as I am writing this and my self image and general sense of self isn't too well defined yet. So all of this is mainly a rough approximation of something that will most
                 likely become much more coherent as I continue to learn more about myself as an individual. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There's another much more personal inspiration for a few of these tracks (especially Creature and Glint) that I won't go into as much detail about because it has to do with my connection to another individual. But this connection had a significant emotional impact on me. When I started many of these tracks I was 17 and
                and experiencing emotions that were very new and beautiful and difficult. There's more to it than that, of course. My main point in saying this is that unlike a lot of my previous work, this music is inspired by some more significant emotions. Not to say my earlier music isn't emotional; just that
                my own personal emotions and experiences played a larger role in the creation of this than they have in the past. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's interesting to think about how i will devolop as an individual in the coming years. I leave for my first semister of college in a few days from now, which will undoubtedly change me. I'm excited and aprehensive, which i imagine are emotions universally experienced by people who share my current status. 
                I wonder if I'm going to be reading back on this and reflecting on my then naivety. There's a lot of things about myself that I don't yet understand, and I'm hopeful that I will come to understand these things better in the future. I'm sure college will present me with many opportunities to do so. 
            </p>
            <P>
                Anyways, that's enough rambling from me. I should get to sleep, my eyes are very tired and my ankles hurt from sitting on my feet for too long. I really really hope that I manage to finish more of the tracks planned for this project in the future; I personally think that they are very cool. Have a great rest of your day :)

                update: writing this on 10/1/24, deep hollow is released in a few hours so i'm changing around this page to include it. Last night i got holes in the sky working on my laptop which i'm excited about; i'm expecting to finish it pretty soon. I'm trying to mix it in my school's studios which is difficult cause I made all of it on my headphones
                ; sorting out the relationships between the low mids and subs is going to be really frusturating, i think. 
                idk, i'm still a very beginner at mixing on actual speakers instead of on headphones, so this track isn't going to be mixed
                 super well (at least hopefully in comparison to future tracks after i've improved a bit). 
                 Idk; i should get back to work i have homework to do. mrrow
