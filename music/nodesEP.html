    <p>a fun 5-track EP that I wrote in late 2021 and finished in 2022. The EP didn't really have any sort of unified vision; it was just 5 tracks that I made at around the same time. I'm still quite proud of the first half of decagonite, I think the mixdown is one of my best. I'm also fond of the rhythmic content in schlonkus, as well as the form and structure in the last track. <br>
    Another interesting bit of "lore" is that Mammatus Clouds won an honorable mention up in a national <a href="https://nafme.org/blog/four-students-named-winners-of-nafme-2022-electronic-music-composition-competition/">competetion</a> for electronic composers in high school, which is neat. </p>
