        <p>i'm condencing all of my old soundcloud uploads (before my first EP) into this page because they're all singles and would take up too much space on the home page. 
            I'm super glad that I uploaded all of my music since I first started using ableton because it's really inspiring to sometimes go back
        and listen to stuff I made and compare it to what I make now. </p>
        <p>i think there used to be more a couple years ago but i may have deleted a few. not sure why. they're probably still on my computer somewhere, but not on the internet. Anyways, 
            I'll list off the tracks in chronological order and IF I remember anything about them I'll provide a description. 
        </p><p>
            also, i suggest reading some of the descriptions that I wrote under the soundcloud tracks when i was younger. they are insane. reading what i wrote when i was 11 - 12 is an experience.

        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/popbot1/blaed">blaed</a> - first time trying to make teh kind of bass music i liked to listen to. i was super proud of this at the time but it's become a little bit of a joke among a couple friends of mine as being really terrible. <br>
