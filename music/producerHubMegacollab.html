    welcome to the most poorly built page on this website so far!
    <p>a megacollab EP i hosted on an older discord server. It was for the 2022 server versus server competetion. During the process of making this I learned a lot about collaboration and compromises and dealing and sorting out problems in a collaboratiev enviornment, and devoloped certain skills on how i can manage stress. The first three tracks were made for the SVS comp, and the fourth track was started before the event as a part of a different project, but I decided to include it in this because it was made by the same people within the same timeframe. <br>
    The way the project was structured was that each track would have a project file manager who would make all the mixing, arrangement, and other exec decisions regarding the  track. I was the project file manager for the third and fourth tracks, my friend <a href=" https://arcerion.carrd.co/ ">arcerion</a> was the manager for the first track, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rannument">rannument</a> was the manager for the second. </p>

        (copypasted from the soundcloud description, so it uses discord usernames which may be outdated. i'm no longer in touch with a lot of these people, unfortunatley, so i'm pretty sure a lot of these people would be difficult to find now)
