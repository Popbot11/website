        <p>I did the primary audio demo for the pigments 6 landing page, using mainly pigments 6 stock presets. the new features are (among lots of other stuff) a new modal filter engine and a vocoder effect.</p>
        <p>it should be stated that I don't own the rights to this audio</p>
        
        this is the audio file (src from archive.org) <br>

        i'm sourcing these files from domains that are not my own cause i'm uncertain of the legality of uploading a file i dont have the rights to onto my own page, i'd rather not take any chances if I on't have to :)<br>
        <audio src="media/pigments6demo_mastered.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>

        also, this is the <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/pigments/overview">pigments landing page</a> as of 1/28/2025. embedded snapshot on archive.org: <br>
        the reason why i'm using archive.org for all this is because they update the website as new versions and new products roll out. <br><br>
