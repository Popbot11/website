        <p>megacollab for the silkenwood sleepover event in june 2023. We had 3 days to make a full finished song. most people did solo tracks or 
            small collabs, but i was involved in a much larger collab. This project was how i met a lot of my close online friends, it was so much fun.
            I primarily played the role as the project file manager for the majority 
            of the time, except for a few hours when i had to go into nyc for a conference, during which boxkitty took over. we also did a fun little transition
            from another parallel megacollab track by a group called the wifi waiters, which you can hear <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wearesilkenwood/wifi-waiters-data-diner">here</a>.
