    <p>my first full album release, 12 tracks. The album is loosely about very large collections of very small things that are only meaningful when considered as a part of a larger group. <br>
        i streamed a portion of the progress on this project, which i compiled into <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx3dnxh7UlpzLPI1kzNFQCtPTtJphpF4r&si=5o5ErOYZ9kIrixdb" target="_blank">this playlist</a>
