    <p>a 6-track EP I made over the summer of 2021. Unlike some of my other EPs, this has some amt of a theme, being the sort of bubble excited idm bass stuff. <br>
    Making this taught me a lot about workflow and sound design, but I still had a lot to learn in terms of mixing and composition. A lot of it employed some seriously ignorant tactics. But that's ok, it's still fun for me to listen to from time to time. <br>
I especially enjoy listening to cascade. Also, i think that restraint is one of the first times i began experimenting with new textures that i wasn't used to hearing. I've got a lot to say about this EP actually, but I need to get back to working on music so i'll probably edit this later with some more in depth info. </p>
