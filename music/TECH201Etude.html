            I wrote this using pro tools for a midterm assignment. The class was called TECH 201; it's the class that people (such as myself) majoring in electronic 
            music stuff usually take in their first semester. AMong other things like learning the basics of voltage controlled synthesis and the history of 
            electronic music throughout the 20th century, we also had to learn pro tools. Ignoring the scum that is AVID, pro tools is actually pretty alright if you're using it for what it's meant to be used for. It's nothing like using ableton, bitwig, blockhead, or any other daw that I know how to use. pro tools' user experience is undoubtedly horrendous. despire this, i was still pleasantly suprised because i only wanted to end my own life for <i>some</i> of the time. <br>
            im super mega insano style yapping right now. the vast majority of the sounds in this piece came from my singing voice and recordings of the synths in my college's studio with me. <br>
            It's nowhere near the same level of polish as what I normally enjoy making, but i'm not really able to export stems from pro tools into ableton to further polish it (which is insane btw. like 30 year old software cant fucking export stems? why the fuck). but yeah its finished and my rule is that if i finish something and i don't plan to include it in a larger project it has to go out. cause its not doing anything useful just rotting on my hard drive. <br>
            hardcore raw html yapping rn 
            I was going to include this on my bare branches album (which as of today jan 9 2025 this is not released and wont be for a while probably) but i wanna keep the tracks in the album to a pretty unified aesthetic, which excludes this track from making sense to be included on it. </p>
