        <p>a megacollab project i worked on through discord for the SVS competetion. led by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stasysmusial" target="_blank">Stasys</a>. 
            My contributions are during the last third of the first track. I played marimba, and arranged a pseudo "drop" bit full of more orchestral/organic sounds. 
            I'm not entirely happy with my section because it was incredibly rushed because of procrastination.
            Happy to have worked with a great group of people tho! It taught me a bit about collaboration styles and habits. 
            One interesting thing was that instead of passing project files back and forth, stasys had just a single project file for everything. 
            He wrote all the melodic and general rhythmic content, split each section up for designated peopole, gave each person a fixed amt of time to work on it, and then re-assembled the bits himself and did a bunch of cohesion and mixing work to get it sounding uniform. 
            it's a really neat way of working, and has def inspired a current project (as of april 6th 2024). Hopefully it's a past project by the time somebody is reading this. 
        idk why anybody would read this tbh. i'm just yapping. nothing of use is in this text. uhh. i mean i guess if you're reading this then i have you're attention. hmmm. my paypal address is legowoodtrashcan@gmail.com. give me money. </p>
