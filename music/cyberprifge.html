            a fun silly midtempo track i made with my friends Arcerion and ZedNotZ. It used a lot of samples from that video of an appliance store commercial that blew up a while ago. The video features a man who is presumably the owner of the franchise (Sam Pak) walking up an aisle of refridgerators for an uncomfortably long time, stoping, leading against a fridge, and then saying with the most genuinely joyful and radiant disposition, "I love refridgerators!". This entire clip takes maybe 15 - 20 seconds, and is probably the most vivid expression of passionate unadulterated self-actualization that exists on the internet. Like, Sam Pak really does love refridgerators. He knows this to be true. It's not just that clip, either. in every other instance of promotional material from Appliance Direct, Sam Pak is there, releasing his joy into the world. I hope that someday I will be able to achieve even a small fracton of the passion for anything that Sam Pak has for appliances. <br>
            anyways. <br>
            I kinda forget why we made the track? It might've been an inside joke, or maybe it was made for a challenge on a discord server. I don't reallly remember. <br>
            I ended up taking the track down from streaming services because somebody (my mom) pointed out to me that the way we used the vocal samples could be interpreted as making fun of Sam Pak's accent. Of course, this was not our intent. We have nothing but the utmost respect for Sam Pak. But yeah, we agreed to take the track down because of this. It's still on my soundcloud, just not anywhere else iirc (maybe youtube?). <br>
