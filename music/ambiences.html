        <p>Ambient music I've made for this specific project. (That's why <a href="Stardust.html">Stardust</a> isn't included). Currently only one track is finished and able to be listened to on soundcloud. Once I finish more of them (hopefully enjough for an LP at least) I'll upload them. Maybe in bulk, maybe as they are completed. NOt sure yet; this project is tsill in its infancy. <br><br>
        I kindly request that if you decide to listen to this music you don't skip through; imo they're best experinced from start to end. Most of my non-ambient work contains a lot of intricate details which makes skipping through a bit more reasonable, but with these ambient tracks I feel like their value lies in their duration and gradual evolution. Of course I don't want to directly influence how you experience the things I create, but it is absolutely worth noting that at the very least <i>I</i> most enjoy listening to these when I do so from start to finish. </p><hr>
        <b>Swells</b><br>
        This track is called swells, I made most of it sitting at a table underneath a tree while the sun was slowly getting lower in the sky, going from early to mid/late afternoon. It was comfortably warm, without notable wind. The background noise comes from the vents behind a building that I recorded, and everything else is a singular phase plant patch that I automated a lot of parameters slowly over time on. <br>
