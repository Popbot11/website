    <p>megacollab project i led for the form all nighter 8 event in august 2023. I was the primary project file manager for the entire thing, and all other other people who helped out contributed sections, ideas, layers, etc etc. 
        i love working on these types of projects. We didnt end up getting accepted into the final allnighter comp thingy, so we decided to polish up the track and release it independently. 
        in the credits ill attempt to remember what each person did but i'm not sure how good i'll be at this. ill try tho.

        myself: main organization, mixing, main project file, contributed to most sections i think, made the section with the guitar and stuff, worked heavily on the drop at 2:07 and made the drop at 6:12<br>
        juha: the most beautiful and amazing and awesome and epic outro ever. its so good. i love it so much. also section between 2:45 and 3:12<br>
        visyura: artwork, everything between 3:40 and 4:45. as well as the initial main melodic motif<br>
        jhl: some of the vocals, a bunch of orchestral stuff, big loud bit before the quiet bit before the other big loud bit. not gonna list specific timestamps cause his stuff is basically everywhere<br>
        fehu: section between 3:12 and 3:39 (i think)<br>
        glyphli: don't quite remember :( i do know she made some awesome pads near the outro and i remember her being in call a lot, but can't exactly recall. i imagine she has a bunch of layers present throughout. <br>
        exorbiter: section between 3:12 and 3:39 (i think)<br>
        lukasipo: iirc, assorted samples, textures, layers, and lukasipo<br>
        unfamiliar: structure and first draft for the drop at 2:08, as well as some drums i think (not sure) <br>
        mleuc: one of the snare samples <br>
