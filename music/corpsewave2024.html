        <p>It's 2024, and we are back with another Corpsewave piece! This time we're on an adventure through the KUSARI star cluster, a distant cluster of star systems arranged in such a way that they are linked together by warp-gates like a chain. Tune in as we visit each star on our roster!
            <br> <br>

            An Exquisite Corpse is a collaborative endeavor to collectively assemble words or images into a composition, with a twist. Each collaborator adds to the composition in sequence, by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous participant contributed.
            <br> <br>
            THIS IS CORPSEWAVE: A Musical Exquisite Corpse. Based on the classical Exquisite Corpse idea, 18 incredibly talented artists from the Worldwave Discord community and outside of it came together to collaborate on the fourth project in the series.
            <br> <br>
            Each artist, in a randomly-arranged list, was tasked to create up to 16 bars in a timespan of 3 days, based ONLY on the 2 last bars of what the previous artist created, importantly NEVER getting a hint of the full composition, until the release. Then, the last 2 bars of their creation were sent forward to the next artist in line. Again, nobody was exposed to anything in the composition except their predecessor's prompts, until the moment of this release!

            Kusari 鎖 - Chain, Strand, Lock
            <br> <br>
            The lineup is bursting with talent as usual, but it's beautiful to see everyone solidifying their individual styles with their own unique toolsets - from an SID chip all the way up to AI samples! If this piece is any indication, expect great things from the artists on this lineup this year!
