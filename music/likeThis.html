        <p>very loud midtempo track. this is the descriptioni provided on the bandcamp page:</p>
        <p>Hi! I've had this track done for a really long time and at first was going to release it with a few other bass music tracks but ehhh I have two larger projects coming soon (IDM EP in a couple of weeks and an album probably by mid-summer or earlier) so I figured i'd rather just put this out instead of sit on it eternally. I know there mixing issues and its clipping in a bunch of places but the people I've shared it with seem to not really care so here it is.

            This track feels like it would be a lot of fun to remix IMO, so if you want stems or the project file (I use Ableton) just email me or shoot me a DM on discord and I'll be happy to send you resources. I will probably edit this description later but for now, that's all I have to say. Here's some links and stuff:</p>
